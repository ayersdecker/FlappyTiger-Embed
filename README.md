## What is this‚ùî

I started to learn Unity this summer about a week ago. This is a result of my learning. It is a Flappy Bird clone with RITchie the RIT Tiger. I don't plan on continuing work on this project, so feel free to use the embed-game I have made! You will need to host all files on a Web-Based Server if you want to use it for your own site without the embed link below. Will not run locally without one. 

‚ö†Ô∏è I am aware of a bug with Unity Embed causing RITchie (Tiger) to not load on startup. Playing a round will cause his sprite to load ‚ö†Ô∏è
