## What is this?

I started to learn Unity this summer about a week ago. This is a result of my learning. It is a Flappy Bird clone with RITchie the RIT Tiger. I don't plan on continuing work on this project so feel free to use this embed-game I have made! You will need to host all files on a Web-Based Server if you want to use it for your own site. Will not run locally without one.
